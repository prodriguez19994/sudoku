# sudoku asynchronous solver

This code does not pretend to be the ultimate sudoku solver.
This project is just a *programming exercice* to experiment *asynchronous programming* with java's *CompletableFutures*.

Indeed multiple *difficult* or *diabolic* sudokus seem to require some *graph explorations*.
I am currently *not* interested in this and this code is *not able* to solve this kind of issues.
